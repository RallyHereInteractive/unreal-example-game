(a)	Your Account Information
You may edit some of your Personal Information through your account or ask us to change, update, or fix your Personal Information in certain cases, including if it’s inaccurate. When you update your account information, we may keep a copy of your previous account details for our records and to prevent fraud or other activities that violate our terms, policies, and agreements. Additionally, please note that by removing some of your data, your ability to use certain functionality of the Website may be limited. Further, if you do not provide us with certain Personal Information, we will no longer be able to provide you with access to certain Services.
(b)	Communication Preferences.
When you register your account, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of receiving Hi-Rez marketing communications, including event invitations, special offers, and newsletters. If you choose to have your account removed from our mailing list, you can do so by adjusting your communications preferences or click the unsubscribe link within the email you received from us. You will not be able to unsubscribe from Service-related communications as they are necessary for us to continue offering you the Services.
To make these or any other requests with respect to your Personal Information, you may contact our support desk at <http://www.hirezstudios.com/submit-support-ticket/> or email privacy@hirezstudios.com.

You can also change your settings for receiving marketing communications on your Hi-Rez Account page at any time. We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor’s identity, if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar purpose. In any case, where we provide information access, deletion, or correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
5.	THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
You may find links to third party websites, payment applications, and widgets on our Site or Services, that we do not own nor control. When you interact with such links or applications, you may leave the Hi-Rez Site you are visiting and go to the website you selected. For example, you may be required to establish a STEAM account with Valve Corporation to use our game(s), and you may be required to provide credit card and other information to Valve Corporation and our other third party payment processors when you purchase products or services from our Site or through our Service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements. Once you leave our Service or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our Site’s Terms of Service.
The Site may also offer you the ability to share your Personal Information through a social networking site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), using such social networking site’s integrated tools (e.g., Facebook “Like” button, or Twitter “Tweet” button). The use of such integrated tools enables you to share Personal Information about yourself with other individuals or the public, depending on the settings that you have established with such social networking site. Additionally, by making Personal Information available on the Site, you “opt in” to allow Hi-Rez to provide such Personal Information to a social networking site without your further consent.

(a)	Summary
We may use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to collect demographic information, personalize your experience on our Site, and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements and behavior within websites. Certain of our websites may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. For example, certain of our websites may use “cookies” or other methods to monitor website usage. We may collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games, and which ads or links are clicked. We may link cookie information to Personal Information.
Certain of our websites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and Hi-Rez does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some areas of our Site will not function properly if you do so.
Other technologies used in our websites include clear GIFs and IP address logging.

We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our webpages, features, or other elements on a webpage. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our webpages.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Hi-Rez, and you do so at your own risk. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, managerial, or other safeguards.

The

c.	As between you and Hi-Rez, you acknowledge Hi-Rez’s exclusive rights in and to the Software Product and that the Software Product is unique and original to Hi-Rez and that Hi-Rez is the exclusive owner thereof. Unless otherwise permitted by law, you shall not, at any time during or after the effective term of this Agreement, dispute or contest, directly or indirectly, Hi-Rez’s exclusive right, title, and interest in and to the Software Product or the validity thereof. You agree to promptly assign to Hi-Rez any and all rights that you may obtain in or to the Software Product arising under applicable law and you hereby appoint Hi-Rez as your attorney in fact for such purpose.

d.	You may permanently transfer all of your rights and obligations under this Agreement to another person only by (i) where applicable, physically transferring the original media (e.g., the CD- ROM or DVD you purchased), all original packaging, and all User Manual(s) and Documentation distributed with the Software Product, or (ii) contacting Hi-Rez and obtaining written approval for the transfer; provided, in both instances, however, that you permanently delete all copies and installations of the Software Product in your possession or control, and that the recipient agrees to and accepts the terms of this Agreement. However, your Account with Hi-Rez is not transferable. The transferor (i.e., you), and not Hi-Rez, agrees to be solely responsible for any taxes, fees, charges, duties, withholdings, assessments, and the like, together with any interest, penalties, and additions imposed in connection with such transfer.

7.	PRE-LOADED SOFTWARE.

The media on or method by which the Game Software is distributed may contain additional software and/or content for which you do not have a license (the "Locked Software"), and you agree that Hi-Rez may install the Locked Software onto your computer or applicable hardware device during the Game Software installation process. You also agree that you will not access, use, distribute, copy, or display the Locked Software, unless and until you receive from Hi-Rez (a) a license to use that Locked Software; and
(b) if and where applicable, a valid alphanumeric key with which to unlock it. If you receive a license and/or a key from Hi-Rez, you may only unlock those portions of a single copy of the Locked Software for which you received a license, and the License Limitation set forth in Section 4 shall apply. The terms of any End User License Agreement displayed after the Locked Software is unlocked will replace and supersede this Agreement, but only with regard to the Locked Software for which you receive a license. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you may make one (1) copy of the Locked Software for archival purposes only.

8.	RIGHT TO MONITOR.

IN ADDITION, THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND ANY RELATED HI-REZ SERVICES MAY MONITOR EACH OF YOUR HARDWARE DEVICE'S RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND/OR ANY RELATED  HI-REZ  SERVICES  DETECTS  AN  UNAUTHORIZED  THIRD  PARTY  PROGRAM,  THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR APPLICABLE HI-REZ SERVICES MAY COMMUNICATE INFORMATION BACK TO HI-REZ, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR ACCOUNT NAME, DETAILS ABOUT THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM DETECTED, THE TIME AND DATE, AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION; AND HI-REZ MAY EXERCISE ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND YOUR RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

In the event that such media proves to be defective during such thirty
(30) calendar day period, and upon presentation to Hi-Rez, or the retailer from whom you purchased the software product, of proof of your purchase, Hi-Rez, or the retailer will, at its sole option, (a) correct the defect in material and workmanship in the media containing the Software Product, (b) provide you with a similar product of  similar value,  or (c) refund the  money you paid for  the Software Product. THE FOREGOING IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO DEFECTIVE MEDIA, THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE GAME SOFTWARE, THE MANUAL, AND ALL DOCUMENTATION AND CONTENT) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

14.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.

NEITHER HI-REZ NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, APPLICABLE HARDWARE DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES. FURTHER, NEITHER HI-REZ NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PLAYER CHARACTERS, VIRTUAL GOODS (E.G., EQUIPMENT, WEAPONS, SKINS, AUDIO PACKS, AESTHETIC FLAIR, ETC.), OR CURRENCY, ACCOUNTS, STATISTICS, OR USER STANDINGS, RANKS, OR PROFILE INFORMATION STORED BY THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICE. HI-REZ SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ISP DISRUPTIONS, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER EVENT WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF DATA OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE. IN NO EVENT WILL HI-REZ BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL HI- REZ’S LIABILITY, OR THE LIABILITY OF ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO HI-REZ DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME SUCH CLAIM AROSE. You hereby agree to
defend, indemnify, and hold Hi-Rez and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and vendors harmless from and against any claim, liability, loss, injury, damage, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Hi-Rez arising out of or related to your use of the Software Product or Service. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

15.	EQUITABLE REMEDIES.

You hereby agree that Hi-Rez would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that Hi-Rez shall be entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any breach of this Agreement, which equitable remedies shall be in addition to such other remedies as Hi-Rez may otherwise have available under applicable law. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees, and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.

16.	GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

a.	To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Hi-Rez agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) calendar days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. Hi-Rez will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to Hi-Rez. You will send your notice to Hi-Rez Studios, Inc., 3750 Brookside Parkway, Suite 200, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022, Attention: Legal Department, or to such other address or person as Hi-Rez may hereafter direct.

b.	If you and Hi-Rez are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Hi-Rez may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA') and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website <www.adr.org>. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather  than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hi-Rez may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

c.	You and Hi-Rez agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Hi- Rez and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

d.	You and Hi-Rez agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Hi-Rez’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for injunctive relief.

e.	Any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America. Any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

f.	Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the Laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For customers who purchased a license to the Software Product in, and are a resident of, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above; provided, however, that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. If you purchased your license to the Software Product in New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand, The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 ("New Zealand Act") may apply to the Software Product and/or the Service as supplied by Hi-Rez to you. If the New Zealand Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have rights or remedies as set out in the New Zealand Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

g.	You and Hi-Rez agree that if any portion of this Section 16 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 16(d)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the applicable section(s) shall be given full force and effect. If Section 16(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Hi-Rez will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of  Section 16(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

17.	MISCELLANEOUS.

This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements; provided, however, that this Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the Terms of Use. To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement conflict with the provisions of the Terms of Use, the conflicting provisions in the Terms of Use shall govern. The provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 10 and 13 through 18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Subject to Section 16(g), if any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

5. 	Accounts.

In order to be a registered user of the Service and the Software Product, you must have or establish an account with Hi-Rez (“Account”) and complete Hi-Rez’s online registration process. Hi-Rez does not provide Internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with your Internet connection. By accepting this Agreement and completing the Account registration process, you represent that you are an adult 18 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 18, you must have the consent of a parent or guardian who is willing to provide their identity and details upon request. Only one person may use an Account. The registered user of an Account may use the Account or may choose instead to permit a child of the registered user who is at least thirteen (13) years of age to use the Account. You are liable for all activities conducted through your Account, and parents or guardians are liable for all activities of their minor child conducted through the Account. To create an Account, you must select a login name and password. Your login name is your Hi-Rez online identity. You may not use a login name that is used by someone else, and your login name cannot be vulgar or otherwise offensive, or be used in any way that violates this Agreement, applicable law or another person’s proprietary rights. You must provide truthful and accurate information in creating your Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your login name, password and Account. You should not reveal your Account information to anyone else or use anyone else’s Account. You agree to immediately notify Hi-Rez of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security of which you are aware. Hi-Rez shall not be responsible for any damages, losses or expenses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account and you agree to indemnify and hold Hi-Rez harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account. This includes, without limitation, any illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have given permission to use your Account. Your Account is at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately, and your Account is subject to termination if you or anyone using your Account violates this Agreement. If your Account is terminated, you may not join the Service again without our express prior written permission. By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree that you license through this and other agreements, and do not own, either the Account you use to access the Service, the characters, avatars or digital items created through the Account or any additional materials, features or content accessed or purchased through the Account or Site. Those persons who have complete the required steps to establish and maintain their Account in good standing are sometimes referred to in this Agreement as “Members.”

6. 	Your Information.

The personal information you submit to Hi-Rez or Hi-Rez collects in connection with your use of the Site or the Service is subject to Hi-Rez’s Privacy Policy at http://www.hirezstudios.com/legal, which is expressly made part of this Agreement. If you have not already read Hi-Rez’s Privacy Policy, you should do so now. If you establish an Account or access the Service, (a) you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information required to register with the Service and establish an Account, and at other points as may be required in the course of using the Service or Products (collectively “Registration Data”), and (b) you agree that Hi-Rez may, whether itself or through third party providers, store and use the Registration Data you provide (such as credit card information) in connection with the Service, including without limitation, for use in maintaining your Account, all as more fully provided in the Privacy Policy.

7. 	Online Content.
You understand that by accessing the Site or using the Service or Products, you may encounter content that may be deemed mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be due to the content or your interactions with other users in the course of accessing the Site, or using the Service or Products. You agree that your access and use of the Site, and if applicable to you, your access and use of the Service and Products, is at your sole risk and that Hi-Rez shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable. Most Product descriptions contain the applicable Entertainment Software Ratings Board rating, if any, and it is your responsibility to be sure that you understand the rating for any Product prior to purchase. The Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement carefully with your parent or legal guardian to make sure that you and your parent or legal guardian understand, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement before purchasing any Product through the Service or Site. Hi-Rez does not endorse, approve, or prescreen any content that you or other users post or communicate on the Service or Site. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Hi-Rez does not assume any responsibility or liability for content that is generated by Members or other guests on or through the Service or Site. We reserve the right to remove any content that is objectionable to us for any reason. This determination is in our sole discretion, and is final. Hi-Rez does not assume any liability for any failure to remove, or any delay in removing, any content. If we have removed content that you created, we may send you a warning. If it is a serious offense or you have violated this Agreement before, we may ban you from participating in the Service and terminate your Account. You also acknowledge that the time that you spend on the Service or Site is solely for entertainment purposes, and that no value can be attributed to such time. In particular (but without limitation), you understand that no value can be attributed to the time that you may spend accumulating digital items or objects or developing content.

8. 	Digital Rights Management and Usage Rules.

You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the Service, Site or any Product. You understand that the Service and Products purchased through the Service may include a security framework using third party digital rights management technology (“DRM”) that protects digital information and limits your use of the Service or Products to certain usage rules established by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers (“Usage Rules”). The DRM may be an inseparable part of a Product, or a separate software component installed directly to a different section of your hard drive when installing such Product. By purchasing any Product through the Service or Site you are consenting to any such installation and continued presence of the DRM on your computer and agreeing to its operation related to the Usage Rules. Such operation may involve the communication between your computer and the systems involved in regulating the Usage Rules. These Usage Rules may limit, among other things, the number of machines on which each Product may be activated or your ability to make copies of each Product. The DRM technology is licensed or provided to Hi-Rez by third parties, and Hi-Rez shall have no responsibility or liability to you for any issues you experience due to such DRM technology. The Usage Rules are subject to change at any time and Hi-Rez makes no promises regarding your ongoing ability to activate Products. You agree to comply with such Usage Rules, and to not attempt to, or assist another person to, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security components related to such Usage Rules for any reason whatsoever. If you live in a jurisdiction in which any of the foregoing activities may not be prohibited by applicable law, you agree to notify Hi-Rez prior to engaging in any such activity, and Hi-Rez will have the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon notice. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers for compliance purposes, and Hi-Rez reserves the right, for and on behalf of itself and such third parties, to enforce the Usage Rules with or without notice to you.

9. 	Product Requirements.

Use of the Site, Service and Products requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and use of the Service and Products may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Site, Service and Products involves hardware, software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use the Site, Service and Products may be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of any particular system requirements for any Product and for your ability to meet such requirements, which may change from time to time. Applicable system requirements at the time of purchase can be found at http://www.hirezstudios.com/legal. Certain Products may also require you to register for an account with a third party (which may require an initial and/or ongoing fee) or to install third party software and content in connection with their use. Hi-Rez does not assume any responsibility or liability for any such fee, account or third party software or content.

10. 	Payment and Delivery. 

If you purchase Products from Hi-Rez, the following terms and conditions shall apply.
Pricing and Sales Tax; VAT. Your total price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable sales, value added taxes or use taxes in effect at the time of purchase, and based on the bill to address. Hi-Rez reserves the right to change prices and availability of Products at any time, and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. Hi-Rez is not responsible for typographic errors in connection with the Service. If a price is materially incorrect when you place an order for a Product, you will be entitled to a refund of the difference. You will not be entitled to any refund for price drops or promotional offerings occurring after the time of your purchase. Failure on Hi-Rez’s part to invoice you for any applicable sales, value added taxes, use taxes, or other taxes does not relieve you of the liability to pay such taxes, and you must pay to the applicable taxing authority any such taxes which may be due as a result of your purchase through the Site or Service.
Orders. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Hi-Rez reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verification or information before accepting any order.
Payment for Products. The Service accepts as forms of payment major credit cards and debit cards that display the MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover logos, PayPal, and such other payment providers, if any, as may be indicated on the purchase page. If a credit card is being used for a purchase, Hi-Rez, through its third party provider, obtains a pm-approval from the credit card company for the amount of the order. You agree to pay for all Products you purchase through the Site or Service, and that Hi-Rez may charge your chosen payment method (such as credit card or PayPal) for any Products purchased, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING HI-REZ WITH VALID PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. All fees will be billed to the payment method you designate during the checkout process. Hi-Rez may pre- populate your payment method and related fields, and you will be responsible for verifying any information in such fields or for changing the payment method designated. Billing to your selected payment method occurs at the time of purchase. If you use the services of an alternate payment method provider such as PayPal, you will be bound by that party’s terms and conditions, which are available on that party’s website. You also may be required to create an account with such payment method provider and to provide that payment method provider with your credit card or other details. If you want to designate a different payment method or credit card or if there is a change in status of your payment method, you must change your information online on the “my account” page of the Service. Hi-Rez reserves the right to change the payment methods offered at any time.
Electronic Signatures and Contracts. Your use of the Service includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS.
Delivery of Products. On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or activation of your Product. Your exclusive and sole remedy with respect to any Product that is not downloadable or able to be activated within a reasonable period will be either replacement of such Product, store credit or refund of the purchase price paid for such Product, as determined by Hi-Rez. Hi-Rez shall have no liability for issues encountered with downloading, activating or using Products due to factors beyond its control, including your computer’s performance and the speed of your Internet connection. In some cases, certain Products may be “pre-ordered,” meaning you will have the opportunity to purchase such Product prior to its release, such that you will have the right to such Product upon its release. You understand that in some instances Product release dates may be delayed and that release dates and times posted on the Service or Site are only estimates, and you will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed release date. For such pre-orders, a portion or all of the Product software may be downloaded onto your computer prior to the release date, though the Product cannot be activated or played until the release date. Hi-Rez may provide you with the option to have such Product software automatically loaded to your computer, and by choosing such option you consent to Hi-Rez’s monitoring your computer’s latency for the purpose of effecting such download. Our obligation to deliver any Product to you shall be complete at the time when and place where you first receive the information necessary to commence download of such Product. In all circumstances it is your responsibility to ensure that the Product is correctly and completely installed on your computer. Once a Product is purchased and you receive the Product, it is your responsibility to keep the Product from being misplaced, damaged or destroyed, and Hi-Rez shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, damage or destruction. Hi-Rez encourages all its users to appropriately back up the Product files and any other elements associated with the Products (such as key information).

27. 	Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Hi-Rez agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. Hi-Rez will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to Hi-Rez. You will send your notice to Hi-Rez Studios, Inc., 3905 Brookside Pkwy, Alpharetta, GA, attn: Account Management Department, or to such other address or person as Hi-Rez may hereafter direct.
(b) If you and Hi-Rez are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Hi-Rez may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hi-Rez may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
(c) You and Hi-Rez agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Hi-Rez and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
(d) You and Hi-Rez agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Hi-Rez’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for injunctive relief.
(e) Any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America. Any Dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
(f) Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For our customers who access the Service from, and are residents of, Canada, Australia, Singapore or New Zealand, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above; provided, however, that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. If you access the Service from New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand, The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (“Act”) may apply to the Service as supplied by Hi-Rez to you. If the Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
(g) You and Hi-Rez agree that if any portion of this Section 27 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of 27(d)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 27(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Hi-Rez will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 27(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

28. 	Miscellaneous. 
This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. The provisions of Sections 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

We may use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to collect demographic information, personalize your experience on our Site, and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements and behavior within websites. Certain of our websites may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. For example, certain of our websites may use “cookies” or other methods to monitor website usage. We may collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games, and which ads or links are clicked.

c.	As between you and Hi-Rez, you acknowledge Hi-Rez’s exclusive rights in and to the Software Product and that the Software Product is unique and original to Hi-Rez and that Hi-Rez is the exclusive owner thereof. Unless otherwise permitted by law, you shall not, at any time during or after the effective term of this Agreement, dispute or contest, directly or indirectly, Hi-Rez’s exclusive right, title, and interest in and to the Software Product or the validity thereof. You agree to promptly assign to Hi-Rez any and all rights that you may obtain in or to the Software Product arising under applicable law and you hereby appoint Hi-Rez as your attorney in fact for such purpose.

d.	You may permanently transfer all of your rights and obligations under this Agreement to another person only by (i) where applicable, physically transferring the original media (e.g., the CD- ROM or DVD you purchased), all original packaging, and all User Manual(s) and Documentation distributed with the Software Product, or (ii) contacting Hi-Rez and obtaining written approval for the transfer; provided, in both instances, however, that you permanently delete all copies and installations of the Software Product in your possession or control, and that the recipient agrees to and accepts the terms of this Agreement. However, your Account with Hi-Rez is not transferable. The transferor (i.e., you), and not Hi-Rez, agrees to be solely responsible for any taxes, fees, charges, duties, withholdings, assessments, and the like, together with any interest, penalties, and additions imposed in connection with such transfer.

7.	PRE-LOADED SOFTWARE.

The media on or method by which the Game Software is distributed may contain additional software and/or content for which you do not have a license (the "Locked Software"), and you agree that Hi-Rez may install the Locked Software onto your computer or applicable hardware device during the Game Software installation process. You also agree that you will not access, use, distribute, copy, or display the Locked Software, unless and until you receive from Hi-Rez (a) a license to use that Locked Software; and
(b) if and where applicable, a valid alphanumeric key with which to unlock it. If you receive a license and/or a key from Hi-Rez, you may only unlock those portions of a single copy of the Locked Software for which you received a license, and the License Limitation set forth in Section 4 shall apply. The terms of any End User License Agreement displayed after the Locked Software is unlocked will replace and supersede this Agreement, but only with regard to the Locked Software for which you receive a license. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you may make one (1) copy of the Locked Software for archival purposes only.

13.	LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Software Product and Service (including, without limitation, the Game Software, the Manual(s), and Documentation) remains with the user. However, Hi-Rez warrants that the media containing the Software Product, if applicable, will be free of defects in material and workmanship for a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the date of your purchase of the software product. In the event that such media proves to be defective during such thirty
(30) calendar day period, and upon presentation to Hi-Rez, or the retailer from whom you purchased the software product, of proof of your purchase, Hi-Rez, or the retailer will, at its sole option, (a) correct the defect in material and workmanship in the media containing the Software Product, (b) provide you with a similar product of  similar value,  or (c) refund the  money you paid for  the Software Product. THE FOREGOING IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO DEFECTIVE MEDIA, THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE GAME SOFTWARE, THE MANUAL, AND ALL DOCUMENTATION AND CONTENT) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

14.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.

NEITHER HI-REZ NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, APPLICABLE HARDWARE DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES. FURTHER, NEITHER HI-REZ NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PLAYER CHARACTERS, VIRTUAL GOODS (E.G., EQUIPMENT, WEAPONS, SKINS, AUDIO PACKS, AESTHETIC FLAIR, ETC.), OR CURRENCY, ACCOUNTS, STATISTICS, OR USER STANDINGS, RANKS, OR PROFILE INFORMATION STORED BY THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICE. HI-REZ SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ISP DISRUPTIONS, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER EVENT WHICH MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF DATA OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE. IN NO EVENT WILL HI-REZ BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL HI- REZ’S LIABILITY, OR THE LIABILITY OF ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, OR VENDORS, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO HI-REZ DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME SUCH CLAIM AROSE. You hereby agree to
defend, indemnify, and hold Hi-Rez and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and vendors harmless from and against any claim, liability, loss, injury, damage, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Hi-Rez arising out of or related to your use of the Software Product or Service. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

15.	EQUITABLE REMEDIES.

You hereby agree that Hi-Rez would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that Hi-Rez shall be entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any breach of this Agreement, which equitable remedies shall be in addition to such other remedies as Hi-Rez may otherwise have available under applicable law. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees, and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.

16.	GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

a.	To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Hi-Rez agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) calendar days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. Hi-Rez will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to Hi-Rez. You will send your notice to Hi-Rez Studios, Inc., 3750 Brookside Parkway, Suite 200, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022, Attention: Legal Department, or to such other address or person as Hi-Rez may hereafter direct.

b.	If you and Hi-Rez are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Hi-Rez may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA') and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website <www.adr.org>. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather  than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hi-Rez may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

c.	You and Hi-Rez agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Hi- Rez and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

d.	You and Hi-Rez agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Hi-Rez’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for injunctive relief.

e.	Any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America. Any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

f.	Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the Laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For customers who purchased a license to the Software Product in, and are a resident of, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above; provided, however, that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. If you purchased your license to the Software Product in New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand, The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 ("New Zealand Act") may apply to the Software Product and/or the Service as supplied by Hi-Rez to you. If the New Zealand Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have rights or remedies as set out in the New Zealand Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

g.	You and Hi-Rez agree that if any portion of this Section 16 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 16(d)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the applicable section(s) shall be given full force and effect. If Section 16(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Hi-Rez will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of  Section 16(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

17.	MISCELLANEOUS.

This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements; provided, however, that this Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the Terms of Use. To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement conflict with the provisions of the Terms of Use, the conflicting provisions in the Terms of Use shall govern. The provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 10 and 13 through 18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Subject to Section 16(g), if any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

7. 	Online Content.
You understand that by accessing the Site or using the Service or Products, you may encounter content that may be deemed mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be due to the content or your interactions with other users in the course of accessing the Site, or using the Service or Products. You agree that your access and use of the Site, and if applicable to you, your access and use of the Service and Products, is at your sole risk and that Hi-Rez shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable. Most Product descriptions contain the applicable Entertainment Software Ratings Board rating, if any, and it is your responsibility to be sure that you understand the rating for any Product prior to purchase. The Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement carefully with your parent or legal guardian to make sure that you and your parent or legal guardian understand, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement before purchasing any Product through the Service or Site. Hi-Rez does not endorse, approve, or prescreen any content that you or other users post or communicate on the Service or Site. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Hi-Rez does not assume any responsibility or liability for content that is generated by Members or other guests on or through the Service or Site. We reserve the right to remove any content that is objectionable to us for any reason. This determination is in our sole discretion, and is final.

You also acknowledge that the time that you spend on the Service or Site is solely for entertainment purposes, and that no value can be attributed to such time. In particular (but without limitation), you understand that no value can be attributed to the time that you may spend accumulating digital items or objects or developing content.

8. 	Digital Rights Management and Usage Rules.

You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the Service, Site or any Product. You understand that the Service and Products purchased through the Service may include a security framework using third party digital rights management technology (“DRM”) that protects digital information and limits your use of the Service or Products to certain usage rules established by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers (“Usage Rules”). The DRM may be an inseparable part of a Product, or a separate software component installed directly to a different section of your hard drive when installing such Product. By purchasing any Product through the Service or Site you are consenting to any such installation and continued presence of the DRM on your computer and agreeing to its operation related to the Usage Rules. Such operation may involve the communication between your computer and the systems involved in regulating the Usage Rules. These Usage Rules may limit, among other things, the number of machines on which each Product may be activated or your ability to make copies of each Product. The DRM technology is licensed or provided to Hi-Rez by third parties, and Hi-Rez shall have no responsibility or liability to you for any issues you experience due to such DRM technology. The Usage Rules are subject to change at any time and Hi-Rez makes no promises regarding your ongoing ability to activate Products. You agree to comply with such Usage Rules, and to not attempt to, or assist another person to, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security components related to such Usage Rules for any reason whatsoever. If you live in a jurisdiction in which any of the foregoing activities may not be prohibited by applicable law, you agree to notify Hi-Rez prior to engaging in any such activity, and Hi-Rez will have the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon notice. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers for compliance purposes, and Hi-Rez reserves the right, for and on behalf of itself and such third parties, to enforce the Usage Rules with or without notice to you.

9. 	Product Requirements.

Use of the Site, Service and Products requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and use of the Service and Products may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Site, Service and Products involves hardware, software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use the Site, Service and Products may be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of any particular system requirements for any Product and for your ability to meet such requirements, which may change from time to time. Applicable system requirements at the time of purchase can be found at http://www.hirezstudios.com/legal. Certain Products may also require you to register for an account with a third party (which may require an initial and/or ongoing fee) or to install third party software and content in connection with their use. Hi-Rez does not assume any responsibility or liability for any such fee, account or third party software or content.

10. 	Payment and Delivery. 

If you purchase Products from Hi-Rez, the following terms and conditions shall apply.
Pricing and Sales Tax; VAT. Your total price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable sales, value added taxes or use taxes in effect at the time of purchase, and based on the bill to address. Hi-Rez reserves the right to change prices and availability of Products at any time, and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. Hi-Rez is not responsible for typographic errors in connection with the Service. If a price is materially incorrect when you place an order for a Product, you will be entitled to a refund of the difference. You will not be entitled to any refund for price drops or promotional offerings occurring after the time of your purchase. Failure on Hi-Rez’s part to invoice you for any applicable sales, value added taxes, use taxes, or other taxes does not relieve you of the liability to pay such taxes, and you must pay to the applicable taxing authority any such taxes which may be due as a result of your purchase through the Site or Service.
Orders. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Hi-Rez reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verification or information before accepting any order.
Payment for Products. The Service accepts as forms of payment major credit cards and debit cards that display the MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover logos, PayPal, and such other payment providers, if any, as may be indicated on the purchase page. If a credit card is being used for a purchase, Hi-Rez, through its third party provider, obtains a pm-approval from the credit card company for the amount of the order. You agree to pay for all Products you purchase through the Site or Service, and that Hi-Rez may charge your chosen payment method (such as credit card or PayPal) for any Products purchased, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING HI-REZ WITH VALID PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. All fees will be billed to the payment method you designate during the checkout process. Hi-Rez may pre- populate your payment method and related fields, and you will be responsible for verifying any information in such fields or for changing the payment method designated. Billing to your selected payment method occurs at the time of purchase. If you use the services of an alternate payment method provider such as PayPal, you will be bound by that party’s terms and conditions, which are available on that party’s website. You also may be required to create an account with such payment method provider and to provide that payment method provider with your credit card or other details. If you want to designate a different payment method or credit card or if there is a change in status of your payment method, you must change your information online on the “my account” page of the Service. Hi-Rez reserves the right to change the payment methods offered at any time.
Electronic Signatures and Contracts. Your use of the Service includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS.
Delivery of Products. On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or activation of your Product. Your exclusive and sole remedy with respect to any Product that is not downloadable or able to be activated within a reasonable period will be either replacement of such Product, store credit or refund of the purchase price paid for such Product, as determined by Hi-Rez. Hi-Rez shall have no liability for issues encountered with downloading, activating or using Products due to factors beyond its control, including your computer’s performance and the speed of your Internet connection. In some cases, certain Products may be “pre-ordered,” meaning you will have the opportunity to purchase such Product prior to its release, such that you will have the right to such Product upon its release. You understand that in some instances Product release dates may be delayed and that release dates and times posted on the Service or Site are only estimates, and you will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed release date. For such pre-orders, a portion or all of the Product software may be downloaded onto your computer prior to the release date, though the Product cannot be activated or played until the release date. Hi-Rez may provide you with the option to have such Product software automatically loaded to your computer, and by choosing such option you consent to Hi-Rez’s monitoring your computer’s latency for the purpose of effecting such download. Our obligation to deliver any Product to you shall be complete at the time when and place where you first receive the information necessary to commence download of such Product. In all circumstances it is your responsibility to ensure that the Product is correctly and completely installed on your computer. Once a Product is purchased and you receive the Product, it is your responsibility to keep the Product from being misplaced, damaged or destroyed, and Hi-Rez shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, damage or destruction. Hi-Rez encourages all its users to appropriately back up the Product files and any other elements associated with the Products (such as key information).
No Ongoing Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Hi-Rez and its licensors reserve the right, without liability to you, to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Products, content, or other materials comprising a part of or sold through the Service or Site at any time without notice. You acknowledge that some aspects of the Service, Site and Products, and administering of the Usage Rules, entails the ongoing involvement of Hi-Rez. Accordingly, in the event that Hi-Rez changes any part of the Service or discontinues the Service, which Hi-Rez may do at its election, you acknowledge that you may no longer be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Hi-Rez shall have no liability to you in such case. You understand that nothing in this Agreement entitles you to any future updates, versions or enhancements to any Product (although Hi-Rez may offer such updates, versions or enhancements in its sole discretion). The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.

27. 	Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Hi-Rez agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. Hi-Rez will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to Hi-Rez. You will send your notice to Hi-Rez Studios, Inc., 3905 Brookside Pkwy, Alpharetta, GA, attn: Account Management Department, or to such other address or person as Hi-Rez may hereafter direct.
(b) If you and Hi-Rez are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Hi-Rez may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hi-Rez may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
(c) You and Hi-Rez agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Hi-Rez and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
(d) You and Hi-Rez agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Hi-Rez’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for injunctive relief.
(e) Any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America. Any Dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
(f) Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For our customers who access the Service from, and are residents of, Canada, Australia, Singapore or New Zealand, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above; provided, however, that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. If you access the Service from New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand, The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (“Act”) may apply to the Service as supplied by Hi-Rez to you. If the Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
(g) You and Hi-Rez agree that if any portion of this Section 27 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of 27(d)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 27(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Hi-Rez will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 27(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

28. 	Miscellaneous. 
This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. The provisions of Sections 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
